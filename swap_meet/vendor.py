### Wave 1

# In Wave 1 we will create the `Vendor` class.

# - There is a module (file) named `vendor.py` inside of the `swap_meet` package (folder)
# - Inside this module, there is a class named `Vendor`
# - Each `Vendor` will have an attribute named `inventory`, which is an empty list by default
# - When we instantiate an instance of `Vendor`, we can optionally pass in a list with the keyword argument `inventory`


# - Every instance of `Vendor` has an instance method named `add`, which takes in one item
# - This method adds the item to the `inventory`
# - This method returns the item that was added

# - Similarly, every instance of `Vendor` has an instance method named `remove`, which takes in one item
# - This method removes the matching item from the `inventory`
# - This method returns the item that was removed
# - If there is no matching item in the `inventory`, the method should return `False`


# def add_to_list_ok(word, word_list=None):
#     word_list = word_list if word_list is not None else []
#     word_list.append(word)
#     return word_list

        self.inventory.append(item)
        return item

            self.inventory.remove(item)
            return item
